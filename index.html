                <p>Hello! I'm Audrey, a fourth-year Computer Science and Business Administration student with a concentration 
                in Marketing Analytics. I am passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to inform business strategies 
                and optimize customer experiences. Through my coursework, I’ve gained expertise in areas such as consumer 
                behavior analysis, predictive modeling, data visualization, and campaign performance measurement.

                In addition to my analytics focus, I enjoy creating software and games that engage and educate users. 
                With proficiency in Java, SQL, and Python, along with experience in several other programming languages, 
                I am well-prepared to tackle diverse projects. Whether it's designing intuitive interfaces, building efficient algorithms, 
                or developing actionable data models, I strive to create impactful solutions that improve people's lives. 
                I am eager to apply my interdisciplinary knowledge to solve complex problems and make meaningful contributions.</p>
            
            </div>

            <p>Beyond my academic work, I enjoy sports, traveling, and reading. I love combining creativity and technology to build new things—like this very website! 
                On the next page, you’ll find a bit more about my favorite hobbies and academic projects.</p>
