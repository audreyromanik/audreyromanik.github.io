        <p>Hello! I'm Audrey, a fourth-year Computer Science and Business Administration student, 
            I am passionate about using my skills to create software and games that help and teach users. 
            With proficiency in Java, SQL, and Python, as well as experience in several other programming languages, 
            I am well-equipped to tackle a variety of projects. I have taken numerous computer science-related courses 
            and am eager to apply my knowledge and develop my skills. Whether it's designing user-friendly interfaces or 
            writing efficient code, I am committed to creating solutions that improve people's lives. </p>

        <p>Beyond my academic work, I enjoy sports, hiking, and reading. I love combining creativity and technology to build new things—like this very website! 
            On the next page, you’ll find a bit more about my favorite hobbies and academic projects.</p>
